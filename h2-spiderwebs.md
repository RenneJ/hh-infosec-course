### Installation
Following Tero's guide I was able to install Java tools. This was done on Monday 28th. I replaced the older jdk version 
11 with the newer 17 on the installation command. So the command i used was:
- $ sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-17-jre ufw wget bash-completion
- (the guide on terokarvinen.com has since been updated to include the newer version)

Enabling firewall on debian as instructed:
	$ sudo ufw enable
You can check the status of your firewall on debian:
