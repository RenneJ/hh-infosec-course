# Summary: [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/) (Braiterman et al. 2020)

Threat modeling = the process of identifying dangers to a system's security or privacy

Key questions to ask when threat modeling:

1. What are we working on?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we do a good enough job?

I think the above questions form the essence of threat modeling and should be repeated throughout any project one participates in.

Threat modeling enables you to perceive the risks in the system and helps you identify them so that proper decisions can be made.

### Do:

- systematic approach
- allow creativity along scientific approach
- varied viewpoints (diverse subject matter experts)
- use proper tools
- implement theory into practice

### Don't:

- think threat modeling is for the few, it is for all
- admire the problem, you need to find practical solutions
- overfocus
- try to create a perfect representation, there is no single ideal view, aim to create many representations to light different problems

1. Do threat modeling early when it is inexpensive to deal with the problems that might rise.
2. Threat modeling is asking yourself (or your team) the four key questions: **What are we working on? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good enough job?**
3. Collaboration is important! Use white boards or equivalent drawing tools to figure out **what are we working on?**
