# Summary: [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/) (Braiterman et al. 2020)

- threat modeling = the process of identifying dangers to a system's security or privacy
- key questions to ask when threat modeling:
1. What are we working on?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we do a good enough job?

I think the above questions form the essence of threat modeling and should be repeated throughout any project one participates in.
