## [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/) (Braiterman et al. 2020)

Threat modeling = the process of identifying dangers to a system's security or privacy

Key questions to ask when threat modeling:

1. What are we working on?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we do a good enough job?

I think the above questions form the essence of threat modeling and should be repeated throughout any project one participates in.

Threat modeling enables you to perceive the risks in the system and helps you identify them so that proper decisions can be made.

### Do:

- systematic approach
- allow creativity along scientific approach
- varied viewpoints (diverse subject matter experts)
- use proper tools
- implement theory into practice

### Don't:

- think threat modeling is for the few, it is for all
- admire the problem, you need to find practical solutions
- overfocus
- try to create a perfect representation, there is no single ideal view, aim to create many representations to light different problems

1. Do threat modeling early when it is inexpensive to deal with the problems that might rise.
2. Threat modeling is asking yourself (or your team) the four key questions: **What are we working on? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good enough job?**
3. Collaboration is important! Use white boards or equivalent drawing tools to figure out **what are we working on?**
4. Sketching is important to express individual thoughts to others.
5. Keep a record of what you're doing. It is beneficial to format it to be professionally presented.
6. Diagrams should be uniform so that everybody understands them.
7. Remember question 2: **what can go wrong?** Pay attention to answers.
8. STRIDE Mnemonic: **Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privileges**. Think about these types of attacks when threat modeling.
9. Track your work!
10. Threat modeling is used to manage risks by informing about possible threats.
11. Would you recommend a colleague to threat model? If yes: good job! Else: keep working on it!

- Everyone should threat model.
- Modeling helps you distinguish the big picture.
- It helps you find issues in things you haven't built yet.
- It allows you to anticipate future threats.
- Effective threat modeling takes time and requires practice.
