# Summary of an episode of Darknet Diaries Podcast
## Ep. 113: Adam
- story of Adam - a young man who turned to crime
- despite his earlier crime record Adam got a job in IT support for a school in the UK, referred to as the Academy
- during his first week on the job Adam noticed serious problems regarding the organizations password policies
- Adam noticed that local admin passwords followed a simple pattern
- same pattern was true for the global domain admin
- as a new employee Adam was unsure how to proceed
- Adam's previous criminal record was only discussed with his supervisor and after a few months said record was used as grounds for termination
- Adam is not happy, gets a new job in IT learns a lot of new IT skills
- years go by
- Adam gets stressed and frustrated at his job, spends late nights playing video games and reading hacker forums
- out of curiosity Adam proceeds to check if they have changed the passwords from before when he worked for the Academy
- no, they hadn't
- Adam spirals deeper and deeper into the Academy's systems, brute forces through VPN (guesses the password)
- he realises that he hasn't covered his tracks at all and knows that he will be easily identified through his IP address
- these are classic examples of lateral movement, after getting into a system he hops onto a different computer gaining more privileged access each hop
- Adam ends up getting access to domain and server controllers, just from knowing the domain name and slightly altering his old password
- in a fear of getting caught or as an act of vengeance against his former employer or both Adam wipes everything clear, what he wipes cannot be even booted again
### Moral of the story is: don't anger a haXXor lol jk take care of your passwords. Change them regularly, don't form patterns and change them again when someone with admin level leaves or is let go from the organization!
