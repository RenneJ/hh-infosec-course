## Applied Cryptography: Chapter 2: Protocol Building Blocks (Schneier, 2015)

### 2.3 One-way Functions

- easy to compute and very hard to reverse
  - hard = it would take millions of years using all current computers
- example:
  - it's easy to break a plate and very hard to put it back together
- there is no mathematical proof for the existence of one-way functions
- **trapdoor one-way functions** have secret that can be used to reverse the function
- example:
  - to disassemble a watch is easy but hard to put back together without a guide (i.e. the secret)

### 2.4 One-way Hash Functions
