# Summaries

## Applied Cryptography: Chapter 2: Protocol Building Blocks (Schneier, 2015)

### 2.3 One-way Functions

- Easy to compute and very hard to reverse
  - Hard = it would take millions of years using all current computers
- Example:
  - It's easy to break a plate and very hard to put it back together
- There is no mathematical proof for the existence of one-way functions
- **Trapdoor one-way functions** have secret that can be used to reverse the function
- Example:
  - To disassemble a watch is easy but hard to put back together without a guide (i.e. the secret)

### 2.4 One-way Hash Functions

- Also called:
  - Compression function
  - Contraction function
  - Message digest
  - Fingerprint
  - Cryptographic checksum
  - Message Integrity Check (MIC)
  - Manipulation Detection Code (MDC)
- Is a part of many protocols
- It takes a variable-length input string (**pre-image**) and converts it to fixed-length output string (**hash value**)
- The point is to compare and to validate a candidate pre-image to previously established (real) pre-image
  - It's easy to compute a hash value but hard to reverse it and it's hard to compute a different pre-image with the same hash value as the original
  - A good one-way function is called collision-free
    - Simple XOR is NOT a good one-way function
- Hashes (or fingerprints, checksums etc.) are a good way to validate the authenticities of files

## Phishing through emails (S√§r√∂kaari, 2018)

### What is phishing?

- Phishing is a practise of sending emails to a target/targets in an attempt to get sensitive data that can be exploited to attacker's benefit
  - The data the attacker seeks can be login credentials, personal information or other sensitive information
  - Phsishing emails can contain links to malicious sites or harmful attachments

### Why people click phishing links?

According to Benenson, Gassman and Landwirth (2016):

- 34% out of curiosity
- 27% message fit expectations
- 16% thought they knew the sender

### Protection mechanisms and how to bypass them

**Sender Policy Framework (SPF)** üõ°Ô∏è

- Email validation system
  - Receiving mail server checks if the sender's IP is allowed to send emails
  - A lot of organisations have misconfigured SPF records
    - Attacker could present themself as a member of that organisation

**DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)** üõ°Ô∏è

- Email validation system
  - Sending mail server attaches a digital signature to email header
  - Recipient can validate that the email hasn't been altered during transit

**Domain Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)** üõ°Ô∏è

- Built on top of SPF and DKIM
- Policy and reporting protocol
 - Notifies if someone is trying to abuse your email (e.g. impersonating as a member of your organisation)

**Filtering** üõ°Ô∏è

- Malware/spam filtering
- Protection against (poorly made) malicious attachments
- URL whitelisting / Web filtering
  - Only specific domains are allowed
    - There are bypasses to appear more legitimate

**Site Cloning** üó°Ô∏è

- Effective for spear-phishing (targeted phishing attacks)
  - Usually goal is to get user credentials
- Using only HTTPS is an effective protection against clone sites

**IDN Homograph Attack** üó°Ô∏è

- Use similar looking characters to bypass detection e.g. cyrillic A looks similar to latin A but has different encoding
 
### What usually works in phishing?

- Package delivery message
  - "You have a package at... tracking code xyz123"
- Mail from IT/Service desk
- LinkedIn, Gmail, Dropbox...
  - Well-known, reputable organisations
- Information related to current events within organisation

### What to do?

- Implement aforementioned protocols (marked with üõ°Ô∏è)
- Keep your domains safe
  - Register similar domains to yourself
- Educate and train users
- Secure infrastructure
  - Properly configured and separated networks within the organisation

### My notes

I was surprised by the numbers presented in the video. The amount of people who clicked the links (in studies and controlled cases) was greater than I expected. Also, it is becoming apparent that faking a legitimate looking site doesn't take much technical skill.
