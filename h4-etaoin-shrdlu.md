# Summary

## Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations (Schneier, 2015)

### 1.1 Terminology

- Sender and Receiver:
  - message is sent and it is important that it's sent securely.
 
- Messages and Encryption
  - message is called plaintext or cleartext (symbol for message *M*, plaintext *P*)
  - hiding the message's information is called encryption (symbol for encryption *E*)
  - encrypted text is called ciphertext (symbol for ciphertext *C*)
  - cryptography = how to keep messages secure
  - cryptanlysis = how to break ciphertext
  - cryptology = field of study (maths) that covers cryptography and cryptanalysis

### 1.2 Steganography

### 1.3 Substitution ciphers and transposition ciphers

### 1.4 Simple XOR

### 1.5 One-time pads

### 1.6 Computer algorithms

### 1.7 Large numbers
